# Possible combinations:
# 1. Test accuracy (test score 0) vs. training iterations / time;
# 2. Test loss (test score 1) time;
# 3. Training loss vs. training iterations / time;
# 4. Learning rate vs. training iterations / time;
# A rarer one: Training time vs. iterations.

# What is the difference between plotting against iterations and time?
# If the overhead in one iteration is too high, one algorithm might appear
# to be faster in terms of progress per iteration and slower when measured
# against time. And the reverse case is not entirely impossible. Thus, some
# papers chose to only publish the more favorable type. It is your freedom
# to decide what to plot.
